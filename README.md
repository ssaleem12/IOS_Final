# GPA Calculator

This app was created for my final project at DePaul University for the class CSC 371 IOS Development. This is an app for any users that wish to calculate their gpa for their school semester. It is only IOS compatible which is made using Swift. This app was very simple to look at it but the features were very different since I had to use many API features to make it different and more presentable. 

# How to Use:
Go to your Command Promp/Terminal
git clone https://github.com/ssaleem12/IOS_Final.git
If you have XCode downloaded, you can basically run it through there or connect it to your phone and have XCode download it over on any IOS device.
